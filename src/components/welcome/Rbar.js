                    Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task.
                    Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] 
                    The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
                    The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. 
                    Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

                    By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. 
                    It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. 
                    Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

                    The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
                    It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

                        JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                        It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

                        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
                        The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

                        Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 
                        Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

                        Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
                    It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
                    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
                    The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
                    The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 
                    As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers

                    .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. 
                    It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
                    Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). 
                    The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling.
                    As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". 
                    FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework.
